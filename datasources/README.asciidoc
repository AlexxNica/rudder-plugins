=== Synopsis

This plugin allows to auto fill node properties with data coming from third party
REST-enable application. 



=== Logging

You can log information about data source (behavior and errors) by adding the following lines in your ```logback.xml``` file:


```
  <!--
    Datasource
    ==========
    Information about data source. 
    "datasources" log what data source are fetched when (info level for updates start, 
    error level for errors, debug/trace for non error returned value).
    
    "datasource-timing" give information about how long it takes to fetch data from
    data source. Debug level is at the data source action level (ex: how long it takes
    to update all nodes), trace times each http request individualy. It can be very
    verbose if you have a couple of thousand of nodes with a "node by node" query type.
